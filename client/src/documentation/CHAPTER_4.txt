CHAPTER 4: METHODOLOGY, RESULTS, AND DISCUSSION

4.1 Introduction
---------------
The development of the Bukid ni Manang Booking System followed the System Development 
Lifecycle (SDLC), a structured framework comprising Planning, Analysis, Design, 
Implementation, Testing, and Maintenance phases. This approach ensured a systematic 
process to create a web-based booking system with email notifications to streamline 
accommodation bookings, reduce guest wait times, and enhance service quality at 
Bukid ni Manang Resort. This chapter details the application of each SDLC phase, 
requirements analysis, system design, implementation, testing, and results, 
demonstrating the system's alignment with the resort's operational needs.
